# InterLock
This open-source password-activated website blocker is designed for privacy-conscious users who prefer not to rely on third-party apps. With this program, users can create a custom blocklist of specific websites and limit their usage using password protection. 

## Features
- Simple and easy-to-use interface
- Timed, Password-activated breaks
- Absolutely Unalterable Blocks (as long as user does not have administrator privileges and knows to edit the system files)
- Blocklist can be easily edited to add or remove websites as needed (only with the password though)
- Can help users stay focused and limit online distractions

## How to Use 
To use the program, simply run the executable file as administrator and enter the password. Then, add any websites that you want to block to the blocklist. Once the blocklist is set, the program will prevent any access to the blocked websites until a break period is allotted or the website is removed from the blocklist.

The initial password to the program is "yourpassword", you can change it via the menu

*Sites in the blocklist will remain to be blocked even after the program is closed. The only way to have permanent access to blocked sites is by removing them from the blocklist.*


## Security
The program uses AES encryption with the password as the encryption key to ensure secure and private blocking of websites. Hence, there's no possible way to alter the blocklist if the password is unkown.

## License
This program is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 License. See LICENSE for more information.
